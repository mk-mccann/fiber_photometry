- (DONE) Want to have a function that grabs the first n episodes of a given behavior in an experiment and plot the mean
+ sem
- (DONE) Want to have e.g. eating zone episodes only when animal was actually eating vs EZ with not eating
    - Dwell filter can only be used for eating
- (DONE) DF for fluorescence data and behavior data combined
    - need to look at Onur's code for generating binary df for behaviors and zones
- (DONE) Saving in H5 files instead of npy files
- (DONE) Naming convention for files
- (DONE) Generate one big h5 file with all instances of all behaviors with preceding 5s window
- Look at interpolation of large jumps
- (DONE) Get the length of behavior duration from the excel spreadsheets and order them from shortest to longest or vice
versa
- (DONE) Filtering based on dwell time
- (DONE) Filtering based on 5s for no behavior

DATA
____
- Dual-channel recordings: Animals 2,4 no expression posterior (?)
- Animal 1 some sort of artifact around 40 min.

ANALYSIS ISSUES
__________

Index out of range - one of the numbers is not in mm.ss format
"['Nesting End'] not in index" - there is a space after the "End" word that needs to get deleted
