- Want to have a function that grabs the first n episodes of a given behavior in an experiment and plot the mean + sem
- Want to have e.g. eating zone episodes only when animal was actually eating vs EZ with not eating
    - Dwell filter can only be used for eating
    - need to look at Onur's code for generating binary df for behaviors and zones
- DF for fluorescence data and behavior data combined
- Saving in H5 files instead of npy files
- Look at interpolation of large jumps
